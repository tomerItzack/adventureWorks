**3 analysis questions:**
1.Is there seasonality in the revenues

2.Is there an upward or downward trend in the company's revenu over the months and years




**1. first question-Is there seasonality in the revenues**

In this question, we seek to examine the seasonality of the months for each year in the context of revenue data. From the data we received, it is difficult to identify clear seasonality because there is missing information for the years 2011 and 2014.

Therefore, when examining the issue of seasonality, we will consider the data for the years 2012 and 2013.

**Conclusions:**
1.Observing that the month of June (the month with the highest revenue) is not the most profitable month. Moreover, in general, the months with the highest revenue are not necessarily the most profitable, and sometimes even result in losses. (June 2012)

2.It can be observed that November is the most profitable month in the years 2011 and 2013. However, since 2011 is the year of the company's establishment and has incomplete data, even in this case, we cannot pinpoint clear seasonality in profitability.

2.we can notice a recurring negative trend in the fourth quarter of each year (2012 Q4, 2013 Q4), which may indicate sales difficulties towards the end of the year/winter seasons.

**Recommendations:**

1.Additional examination of the company's revenue and profitability according to months towards the end of the current year (2014) is warranted.
2.We should explore how to increase profitability in months where we identified a specific seasonal trend associated with low profitability or even losses (June 2012, June 2013).
3.It is imperative to delve deeply into the factors contributing to the negative growth in revenue in the last quarters of the represented years (2012, 2013).




**2.second question-Is there seasonality in the revenues**

**Conclusions:**
1.According to the data, there appears to be instability in the company's growth over time. The percentage changes in sales from quarter to quarter show significant volatility, with some quarters experiencing high growth, while others see a decline in growth rates, and even quarters with negative growth.

2.Despite the volatility in growth (QoQ), there is an overall upward trend in revenues over the years. Total revenues have increased from relatively low levels in 2011 to higher levels in 2013 and 2014.

3.There is no correlation between the upward trend in revenues and profitability. While there is a consistent increase in revenues over the years, profitability remains relatively marginal.

4.A sharp decline in April 2012 data: there are notably low revenues and exceptionally negative profitability in April, followed by a rapid recovery in the subsequent month.

5.The beginning of an upward trend in the company's profitability can be identified starting in the second half of 2013.



**Recommendations:**
1. Examination of revenue and profitability trends over a longer period.
2. Investigate the factors contributing to the volatility in quarterly revenue growth (e.g., seasonal factors like winter, discounts, extraordinary events, etc.).
3. Determine the cause of the sharp decline in revenues and profitability in April 2012.
4. Analyze the factors affecting the relatively low profit margins and examine the possible reasons for the beginning of the upward trend starting in July 2013.

**Conclusions:**
1. **Online Stores Are More Profitable Than Physical Stores**:
    - In all countries examined, online stores showed positive profitability, while physical stores lost money.
    - It appears that the online business model generates better financial results for the company.

2. **Highest Profits from Online Stores**:
    - Online stores in Australia and the Southwestern United States generated the highest profits among all countries.

3. **Notable Losses in Physical Stores**:
    - The losses in physical stores are particularly significant in Canada and the Southwestern United States.



**Recommendations:**
1.**Further Analysis of Loss Factors in Physical Stores**:

We need to examine the consistent losses in physical stores across all countries by investigating factors such as:

- **Operational Costs**: Evaluate the expenses related to running the stores, including rent, utilities, and staffing.
- **Pricing**: Assess the pricing strategy to ensure it is competitive and aligned with market demand.
- **Store Locations**: Analyze the locations of the stores to determine if they are in high-traffic, profitable areas.
- **Customer Service**: Review the quality of customer service to identify any areas that may be affecting customer satisfaction and repeat business.

By understanding these factors, we can identify opportunities to improve profitability in physical stores.

2.**Focusing on Online Store Strategy and Exploring the Potential for a Comprehensive Shift to Online Sales**:

By increasing investment in online platforms and improving the user experience, we can capitalize on the higher profitability of this channel.

3.Increasing digital marketing budgets in the countries that generated the highest profits (Australia and the Southwestern United States). In countries where the company is already leading in digital profitability, it has an advantage over competitors. This approach will allow the company to leverage existing success and expand market share without needing significant investments in developing new markets.

3.By implementing these measures, the company can increase overall profitability, optimize the business model, and tailor the digital marketing strategy to more profitable markets.
